    <h1>This page is about Jacob Willams.</h1>

    <h3>Welcome to my page.</h3>

    <p>Hi, I’m Jacob Williams — a middle-distance runner from New Zealand with a deep love for the sport and the process behind it.

Running, for me, is more than competition. It’s early mornings chasing marginal gains, pushing through tough sessions when no one’s watching, and representing the pride and resilience that come with being a Kiwi athlete. From local meets to bigger stages, every race is an opportunity to test my limits and raise them.

As an NZ runner, I’m driven by progression — constantly refining my training, strengthening my mindset, and building toward performances that reflect the work put in behind the scenes. I believe consistency beats motivation, discipline shapes results, and setbacks are just part of the story.

This site is where I share my journey — the training, the racing, the lessons, and everything in between. Whether you’re here to follow my progress, connect, or collaborate, I appreciate the support.

Let’s see how fast we can go.</p>
