    <h1>This page is dedicated to Middle Distance Running.</h1>

    <h3>I'm Jacob Williams, and I will be your guide for today.</h4>

    <p>New Zealand has a proud and influential history in middle-distance running, consistently producing world-class 800 m and 1500 m athletes since the early 20th century. 
      The tradition began with Jack Lovelock, who won 1500 m gold at the 1936 Berlin Olympics in world-record time, establishing New Zealand as a force in the event. 
      In the 1960s, Peter Snell became one of the greatest middle-distance runners in history, winning three Olympic gold medals and setting multiple world records under coach Arthur Lydiard’s revolutionary endurance system. 
      The legacy continued with John Walker, the 1976 Olympic 1500 m champion and first man to break 3:50 for the mile, and later with Nick Willis, who won Olympic medals in 2008 and 2016. 
      Now the next chapter is being written by teenage prodigy Sam Ruthe, who has already broken age-group records and emerged as one of the most exciting young middle-distance talents in the world, signaling that New Zealand’s remarkable tradition in the metric mile is far from over.</p>
